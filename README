twitter-sample-reactive
=======

twitter-sample-reactive is an experiment to see if merging different twitter random sample streams gives more throughput (tweets per second) than a single random sample stream.

Answer: You do not get increased throughput by merging different random samples, Twitter gives same random sample to everyone.


How to run:-

Populate  src/main/resources/twitter_credentials.yaml   file with some twitter credentials. For merging multiple stream you need more than 1 account as you cannot open more than 1 stream per account.


mvn clean compile package


To all options

java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar


To view help
java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar    help single
java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar    help merge


To run a single stream :

java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar -c twitter_credentials.yaml single

You will see TPS (tweets per second) in the output console.


To run a merged stream :

java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar -c twitter_credentials.yaml single


You will see increased TPS



To run a merged stream with duplicated removed :

java -jar target/twitter-sample-reactive-0.1.jar -c twitter_credentials.yaml single  -dropDuplicates


You will see TPS almost the same as single stream.
